## Introduction

The **Invoice Information Extractor** is a user-friendly web application designed for businesses and individuals who frequently handle invoices and need an automated tool to extract, organize, and manage invoice data. By leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this tool allows users to easily upload invoices in the form of images or PDF files and automatically extract relevant data, such as vendor names, dates, amounts, and more.

Built with **Reactjs** and **Python**, the application offers a clean and interactive interface that enables users to view, modify, and delete invoice information. Extracted data can be displayed in both JSON and table formats, making it easy for users to verify and work with the data. Additionally, the tool offers the functionality to generate reports and send them via email.
